- Swift 5.3+
- Xcode 14.0+

## Import

Import `HeartRatePkg` into your `View`

```
import HeartRatePkg
```

## How to Use

- Step 1: Using Notification Observer, you need to define method in any of your class wherein add notification and add its action method to record measuring heart rate. Below is the code:

``` 
    func notificationObserver() {
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: Notification.Name.ReadHeartRate, object: nil, queue: nil, using: getReadings(_:))
    }
    
    func getReadings(_ notification: Notification) {
        if let notificationData = notification.object as? Double {
            // USE READING IN YOUR CODE
            print("ACTUAL READING :> \(notificationData)")
        }
    }
```


- Step 2: Call 'initiateHRMeasuring()' method to start/initiate measurement of Heart Rate.
- Step 3: Also call 'notificationObserver()' method defined in step 1, below is the code:

```
    // CALL BELOW METHOD IS START MEASUREMENT
    self.initiateHRMeasuring()
    self.notificationObserver()
```
